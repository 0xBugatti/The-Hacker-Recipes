# Introduction

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This project is a work in progress**. I started it in 2018 and will probably finish it by 2022. I mostly worked on the "Active Directory" and "Web services" parts right now. They are good examples of what I want this whole project to be like.

The üõ†Ô∏è emoji is used where the work is not over.

This project is aimed at freely providing technical guides on various hacking topics:

* Active Directory services
* Servers
* Web services
* Intelligence gathering
* Physical intrusion
* Social engineering
* Phishing
* Mobile apps
* ...

Cheatsheets are huge resources, but they sometimes lack simplicity or on the contrary not giving any context or explanation. This is not a cheatsheets project. Everything here will be verified, tested, and not only copy pasted from I don't know where.

Keep in mind that these guides are maintained by non-omniscient security enthusiasts in their spare time. You will probably find things missing or mistakes.
