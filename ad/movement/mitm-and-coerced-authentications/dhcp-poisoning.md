# DHCP poisoning

## Theory

When a workstation reboots or plugs into a network, a broadcast DHCP request is emitted. It's goal is to ask for network settings like an IPv4 address.

> Windows uses several custom DHCP options such as NetBIOS, WINS, WPAD settings. When a workstation sends a DHCP request to get its networking settings, these additional settings can be included in the DHCP answer to facilitate straightforward connectivity and name resolution. _(_[_Laurent Gaffi√©_](https://g-laurent.blogspot.com/2021/08/responders-dhcp-poisoner.html)_)_

[DHCP's option 252](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/bb794881\(v=technet.10\)) provides Windows machines with a WPAD configuration. An attacker able to answer broadcast DHCP queries faster than the legit DHCP server can inject any network setting on the requesting client.

## Practice

[Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder) (Python) can be used to operate DHCP poisoning in the following manner

* race against the legit DHCP server to answer `DHCP REQUEST` messages
* sent a DHCP ACK response with a rogue WPAD server address in `option 252` in the network parameters, with a short lease (10 seconds). Responder can also be used to attempt at injecting a DNS server instead.
* wait the lease to expire so that the poisoned client asks for a new lease
* let the client obtain a legitimate lease from the real DHCP server, allowing the client to obtain the right network settings and have connectivity
* the injected WPAD server address will stay until the client reboots (that's how Windows works :man\_shrugging: ). If the injected field was a DNS server, it will be overwritten with the new legit DHCP lease.
* with the injected WPAD server address, the Windows client will try to obtain the `wpad.dat` file on the rogue WPAD. Responder will then require the client to authenticate.

The attack can be started with the `-d/--DHCP` (WPAD injection) or `-D/--DHCP-DNS` (DNS injection) arguments (either or the other, if both options are set, `-D` will take the precedence).

When using the `-d/--DHCP` argument, the `--wredir` and `--ProxyAuth` need to be added to force the Windows client to authenticate once the `wpad.dat` is accessed in order to capture hashes.

```bash
responder --interface "eth0" --DHCP --wredir --ProxyAuth --verbose
```

The proxy auth NTLM authentication can either be [captured](../ntlm/capture.md) with Responder with the command line above or [relayed](../ntlm/relay.md) with [ntlmrelayx](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) (by using the `--http-port 3128` argument. The `--wredir` and `--ProxyAuth` arguments need to be removed from Responder's command line.).
