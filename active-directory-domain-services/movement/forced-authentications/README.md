# Forced authentications

In Active Directory domains, attackers often rely on forced authentications and MITM \(man in the middle\) to operate lateral movement, especially when attempting authentication relaying attacks \(e.g. [NTLM relay](../abusing-lm-and-ntlm/relay.md)\) or when [abusing Kerberos delegations](../abusing-kerberos/delegations.md).

These techniques enable attackers to redirect traffic or redirect/force targets authentications. Attackers will then be able, in certain cases, to capture credentials or relay authentications.

There are many ways attackers can do MITM or redirect/force targets authentications, most of which can be combined for maximum impact \(and minimum stealth\).
