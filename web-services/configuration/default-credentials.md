# üõ†Ô∏è Default credentials

Default credentials are a really simple and extremely common way to get an initial access to a system. Many devices (especially in the Internet of Things) come with default non-random password that are often left unchanged. Here is an example of a few very common credentials :

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| `admin`  | `admin`  |
| `root`   | `root`   |
| `tomcat`   | `tomcat`   |
| `password` | `password`  |

You can find many of them on these two sites :

 - [https://cirt.net/passwords](https://cirt.net/passwords)
 - [https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/](https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/)

You can also pick passwords from the list of the most common passwords : 

 - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords)

If you can't find the password in these lists, you can also find them in user manuals or directly with google dorks. Example of a useful Google Dork :

```
intext:'password' intext:'default' Application Name
```
