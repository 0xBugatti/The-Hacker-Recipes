# üõ†Ô∏è Default credentials

Default credentials are a really simple and extremely common way to get an initial access to a system. Many devices (especially in the Internet of Things) come with default non-random password that are often left unchanged. You can find many of them on these two sites :

 - [https://cirt.net/passwords](https://cirt.net/passwords)
 - [https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/](https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/)

If you can't find the password in this list, you can often find them in user manuals or directly with google dorks. Example of a useful Google Dork :

```
intext:'password' intext:'default' Application Name
```
