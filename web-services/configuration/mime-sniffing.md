# üõ†Ô∏è MIME sniffing

## Theory

MIME sniffing represents the action that the browser does in retrieving a content type on its own \(even if the `Content-Type` header is present\).

The simplest example involves a client sending a `file.jpg` containing malicious HTML code and the attacker uploading it on the server \(some websites would allow users to only upload `.jpg` extension files\). If the browser does MIME sniffing, it may render the `file.jpg` as a HTML MIME type \(allowing the attacker to execute an XSS for example\).

Each browser has different behavior, check the browsers' specifications for more details.

### Mitigation

Two steps to follow for the mitigation:

1. Include a valid `Content-Type` header.
2. Include a `X-Content-Type-Options` with the directive `nosniff`.
