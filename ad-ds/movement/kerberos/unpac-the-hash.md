# UnPAC-the-hash

## Theory

> PKINIT allows WHfB users, or, more traditionally, smartcard users, to perform Kerberos authentication and obtain a TGT. But what if they need to access resources that require NTLM authentication? To address that, the client can obtain a special Service Ticket that contains their NTLM hash inside the Privilege Attribute Certificate \(PAC\) in an encrypted NTLM\_SUPPLEMENTAL\_CREDENTIAL entity. \([shenaniganslabs.io](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2021/06/21/Shadow-Credentials.html)\)
